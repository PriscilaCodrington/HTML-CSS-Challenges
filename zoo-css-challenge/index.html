        <h2>Tiger Facts</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Tigers are the largest cat species in the world reaching up to 3.3
            meters in length and weighing up to 670 pounds!
          </li>
          <li>
            Tigers are easily recognizable with their dark vertical stripes and
            reddish/orange fur.
          </li>
          <li>The Bengal tiger is the most common tiger.</li>
          <li>Tigers live between 20-26 years in the wild.</li>
          <li>
            Unlike most other cats, tigers are great swimmers and actually like
            the water.

        <h2>Giraffe</h2>

        <p>
          Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering
          legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many
          humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as
          35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10
          miles an hour over longer distances.
        </p>

        <h3>Behavior</h3>

        <p>
          Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small
          groups of about half a dozen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and
          heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal
          submits and walks away.
        </p>

        <h3>Height and Size</h3>

        <p>
          Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and
          buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a
          favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps
          them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time
          and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats
          hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find
          enough food.

        <h2>Capybara friendly</h2>

        <p>
			A common capybara can weigh 90 kilos. with a serious gesture
			—almost stoic— and the four heavy fingers he has on each of his
			legs, it could pass for being a ferocious rodent that lives in perfect
			solitude, enjoying the quagmire in the humid forests of
			Latin America. Nature tells another story. Chickens, monkeys,
			turtles, various types of birds. For capybaras (Hydrochaeris
			hydrochaeris) by its scientific name—there are no limits on the ground
			friendly. Science does not yet have an answer to explain why.
			why these animals are so well received among different species
			wild. One of the explanations that has been given is his character
			always peaceful. In general, they are not aggressive animals, nor do they
			they are distinguished by making a lot of noise. Since they are excellent swimmers, others
			smaller animals lean on them as a "bus" to cross
			Moving bodies of water.
